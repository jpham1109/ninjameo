### Hi there 👋

Nice to meet you. My name is Jamie and I have started my coding journey in 2020 and boy it's been joyride 😝  
💙 I love JS/TS, design, APIs integration, a beautiful UI and stellar UX.  
🌱 I'm currently learning to program with Node JS, tRPC and Tailwind  
🩰 On my free time I love being behind the bar 🍸🍻  at some of NYC's most beloved music venues
